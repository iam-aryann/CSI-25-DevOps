# Week 4: Docker
## Task 1: Introduction to Containerization and Docker Fundamentals, Basic Commands

**Description**:  
This task introduces containerization and Docker, covering Docker architecture and basic commands for managing containers and images.

---

## What is Containerization?
Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization, encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a single container. Containers are portable and can run on any system with Docker installed, regardless of the underlying operating system.

---

## Docker Fundamentals
Docker is a platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight containers. Key components include:

- **Docker Engine**: The runtime that builds and runs containers.
- **Docker Images**: Templates used to create containers.
- **Docker Containers**: Running instances of Docker images.
- **Dockerfile**: Script with instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Hub**: A public registry for Docker images.

### 2. Run a Container from Image
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
Pulls the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub and runs it in a container to verify Docker is working.

### 3. Pull an Image
```bash
docker pull ubuntu
```
Downloads the `ubuntu` image from Docker Hub.

### 4. List All Docker Images
```bash
docker images
```
Displays all locally stored Docker images.

### 5. List Running Containers
```bash
docker ps
```
Shows currently running containers.

### 6. List All Containers (Running + Exited)
```bash
docker ps -a
```
Displays all containers, including stopped ones.

### 7. Run Ubuntu Container Interactively
```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```
Starts an interactive Ubuntu container with a terminal session.

### 8. Exit a Running Container
```bash
exit
```
Exits the containerâ€™s interactive session.

### 9. Remove a Container
```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```
Removes a specified container (use `docker ps -a` to find the container ID).

### 10. Remove an Image
```bash
docker rmi <image_id>
```
Deletes a specified Docker image (use `docker images` to find the image ID).

### 11. Start/Stop a Container
```bash
docker start <container_id>
docker stop <container_id>
```
Starts or stops a container by its ID.
