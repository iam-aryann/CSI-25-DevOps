# Week 4: Docker
## Task 1: Introduction to Containerization and Docker Fundamentals, Basic Commands

**Description**:  
This task introduces containerization and Docker, covering Docker architecture and basic commands for managing containers and images.

---

## What is Containerization?
Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization, encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a single container. Containers are portable and can run on any system with Docker installed, regardless of the underlying operating system.

---

## Docker Fundamentals
Docker is a platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight containers. Key components include:

- **Docker Engine**: The runtime that builds and runs containers.
- **Docker Images**: Templates used to create containers.
- **Docker Containers**: Running instances of Docker images.
- **Dockerfile**: Script with instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Hub**: A public registry for Docker images.

## Basic Docker Commands

### 2. Run a Container from Image
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
Pulls the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub and runs it in a container to verify Docker is working.
